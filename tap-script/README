Most complicated, but flexible way.

Pros:
 - good run abstraction (you can have many plugins for one service,
 which simply recombines your components; and you always know thats
 your run scripts are in the twisted/plugins)
 - you can use command line arguments
 - you can use twisted AOP style configuration (through interfaces etc)
 - you can skip many of configuration boilerplate as logging (twistd take care of)

Cons:
 - complicated
 - hard to use debugging tools (Idea, PyDev)
