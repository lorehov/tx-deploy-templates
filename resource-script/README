The easiest way.
Pros:
 - almost 0 boilerplate
 - twistd web take care about logging, reactor, port, ssl

Cons:
 - you can't use custom command line arguments
 - you can only run Web resources in such way (no low level TCP endpoints etc)

How to deploy/run:
   - install package
   - put *.rpy files in directory owned by service-user
   - put *.conf in where you expects them
   - in init.d script use something like this:
   "twistd -r epoll -u $uid -g $gid --pidfile=/var/run/serv/twistd.pid web -n --resource-script=/usr/lib/serv/server.rpy -p 3000 -l /var/log/serv/twistd.log "

P.S.: Such way is very usefull when you want to set up a cluster of multiple similar twisted services,
but don want to make things complex using manual process managing (using multiprocessing for ex) and use
shell + zabbix instead.
