The most flexible way.

Pros:
 - we can freely use command line arguments
 - we can easily use config files
 - we can install service as package and start it as a service, using init scripts
 - we can start service manually from some occasional dir (/home/beast/www/service)

Cons:
 - we must declare and handle all command line options manually (so some ugly things appears:
   logging setting up, reactor setting up)
 - many of boilerplate code if we want to use many facades (Web, TCP and other I means)

 Why using conf as config: because xml is awful and json is not readable.

 Proposed ways to deploy/run:
    - install package
    - put run files in directory owned by service-user
    - put *.conf in where you expects them
    - in init.d script use something like this:
    "/usr/bin/serv/run -r epoll -c /etc/serv/serv.conf -l /var/log/serv/twistd.log "

 How we can reduce amount of the boilerplate code.
 1. Obviously we can make some OptionsAbstract class where we put our general options (log, config, etc) and create
    some function(s) for handling there, for ex. initLog(opts), etc.
